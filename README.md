## Playground
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)

## How we use TypeScript
anything with ```.ts, .tsx``` is a typescript file.

## Type Annotation

```var add: Type = true```
```var add: TypeAnnotation = true```

## Type Inference
Refers to the typescript compiler's ability to infer types from certain values in your code.

## The :any Type
- doesn't do any type checking
